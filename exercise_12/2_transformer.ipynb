    "# Transformers - Attention is All You Need\n",
    "Welcome to the captivating world of Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In recent years, Transformers have emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in NLP, revolutionizing how we comprehend and process language. Unlike older architectures such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and allowing for parallelization of computations. The seminal paper ['Attention Is All You Need'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the Transformer model, showcasing its prowess in various language tasks and laying the foundation for its widespread adoption. This Jupyter notebook is designed to unravel the intricacies of Transformers, highlighting their architectural nuances, contrasting them with traditional models, and demonstrating their applications across diverse NLP domains! (And in case you were wondering - yes, a certain transformer model created this text :D)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will stick very closely to the implementation presented in the paper to build our own translation model! There is no need to read it though, you can find the necessary sections of the paper before each task, together with some explanations. If you did not work on exercise 11, we would really advise you to do that first, since we will pick up on many of those topics!\n",

    "Like already mentioned - Training is really where Transformers show there advantages compared to other sequential models! We can use a technique called **Teacher Forcing**, which means we feed the model the correct sentence, and the model only has to predict the next word! This is super easy to do in Transformers due to the causal masks we discussed earlier! In fact, all we have to do is pass the entire correct sentence into the decoder, and let it run exactly one time. The masking will make sure, each predicted word only depends on the previous words - no need to loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will not train a large model on a huge dataset, this would simply take too long and also isn't the focus of this exercise! However, you will have to implement the parts of the Trainer class, particular the forward pass! Note that have implemented a couple of extra functionalities, such as training from a checkpoint and a gradient accumulation. Gradient accumulation is used, to decouple the batch size from the optimizing step. Instead of performing an update after every batch, we can update our network after n batches. That way, we can choose a smaller batch size to save RAM, and still have the same effects as we would have with a larger batch! Be aware, that this doesn't work as nicely with batch normalization!"

The sentence is then tokenized, so that we can feed it into the model. The first decoder input will only be the start token, which in our model is the same as the end token! The model will give us an output distribution over all tokens in our vocabulary. We can then either choose the token with the highest probability, or we can sample from this categorical distribution! That way, every answer will be slightly different! The last output is added to the decoder sequence and on it goes! If the model predicts an end token, we stop the algorithm.
